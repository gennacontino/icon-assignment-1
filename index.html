        <p>NEW YORK - Dozens of small business owners are taking bets on Bushwick.</p>

        <p>The north Brooklyn neighborhood reminds Jae Lee of the East Village, where his flagship Korean-American restaurant Nowon is located. Nowon Bushwick opened in July.
        </p>
        <p>Bushwick saw a net growth of up to 150 small businesses between 2020 and 2022, creating a “hub of entrepreneurship,” according to a May 2023 New York City Economic Development Corporation report.</p>
        <p>Business owners say the Bushwick's recent population growth and street art are some of the qualities that are drawing them to the neighborhood. </p>
        <p>It's one of the neighborhoods in Brooklyn that's helping drive the city's small business recovery post-pandemic when New York as a whole has seen a net loss of small business - with significant losses in Midtown and lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>“You know what's happening in a neighborhood just by watching the storefronts,” said Edward Snajdr, a cultural anthropologist who researches gentrification aesthetics in Brooklyn. </p>
        <p> “In a place like Bushwick, which is really interesting to me, most of the time when I'm there I feel like I'm in old school New York,” Snajdr said. “Then I see a sign and I say, ‘No, I'm actually in gentrifying New York.’ The story isn’t complete, they’re in the process.” </p>

      Bushwick is just a chapter in the story of Brooklyn’s growing small business economy. The entire borough saw a net gain of 8,000 new businesses from 2020 to 2022. </p>
      <p>Nowon, the Korean American restaurant, is only reaching $3,000 to $4,000 of its $10,000 sales goal on a typical weekday, but Lee isn’t too worried. </p>

  <p>On weekends, the restaurant is getting closer to making a $15,000 daily sales goal - and he attributes that to the neighborhood’s nightlife. As more people move to the neighborhood and more small businesses open, he’s hopeful business will only get better.</p>
<p>“A rising tide floats all boats,” he said.</p>

      <p>When Carolina Wang found a spot for her bakery and cafe, Saint Michel Cafe and Bakery, on Irving Avenue, she decided to move into the neighborhood from Astoria, Queens. Aware of the rapid change in the neighborhood, she began advocating for improvements to Irving Square Park and helped connect older residents to civic services and local government meetings.</p>

<p>“I wanted to open a shop in Bushwick and didn’t think it was right to open a business and not be a part of the community,” Wang said. </p>

<p>Soon after the cafe opened in November 2022 with three employees, including Wang and her co-owner, business was tough. There were days when sales barely reached $50. Nearly a year in, after getting to know neighbors who became “like family,” she said regulars began to flow in. </p>

<p>Though more businesses are opening than closing in Bushwick, some owners of those new businesses say they’ve faced financial challenges. </p>

<p>Chef and artist Fernando Aciar opened a wine bar in his studio between Bushwick and Bed Stuy last September, and is anticipating a more prosperous spring and summer. </p>

<p>The creative space side of his business, OSTUDIO, keeps about 15 to 20 creative memberships monthly, but he describes the current state of the restaurant industry as “survival mode.”</p>

<p>“I think we will be successful in different times, right now is survival,” Aciar said. “I believe the food industry is in its worst. Everything is extremely expensive. I opened 12 to 14 places and I never saw the unbalance we are experiencing today.”</p>
